This analysis uses some popular R libraries to ease processing.
```{r message=FALSE,warning=FALSE}
library(plyr)
library(dplyr)
```

## Loading and preprocessing the data

You must first unzip the activity.zip file.

```{r loadData}
wp <- file("activity/activity.csv") 
theData <- read.csv(wp)
head(theData)
```

## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?

```{r calcMean}
df2 <- theData %>% group_by(date) %>% summarize(totalSteps = sum(steps,na.rm=TRUE)) 
df2 %>% summarize(mean(totalSteps))
```

## What is the average daily activity pattern?



## Imputing missing values



## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?
